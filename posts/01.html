        <h1>The pains of Async.</h1> <a href="../index.html">Go back!</a><br><br>

        So, let's ask the most sensible question here. What are asynchronous operations?
        <br>
        In a very oversimplified sense, they're just operations that are out of order (not-synchronous), like
        "regular" synchronous operations.
        <br>
        In many programming languages, usually it's very simple to handle such stuff, most of the work is done for you
        by the compiler/interpreter/wizard in your computer/whatever. However in a fancy unknown language known as Rust, 
        you are left with some nice freedom (with comes with consequences and responsibility!) to build your own runtime.
        <br><br>
        However you are provided with several tools, like the Waker, the Context and the Future trait.
        
        <h2>What is a waker?</h2>
        The Rust waker is essentially just a struct with a pointer to some *data* and a pointer to a virtual function table.<br>
        Seems very generic, however it's purpose is to somehow inform our runtime that it's time to *poll* the task! Of course we could infinitely loop
        till a Future returned that it's ready, but that is very inefficient. The waker can also be used to create a *Context* which only exists to... provide a waker.
        <br>

        <h2>Out-of-context context?</h2>
        The context is a struct roughly containing some data of any time (it's unused private ext field) and a reference to a waker.
        Currently it only serves as a parameter to the poll function provided by the Future trait.

        <h2>Future trait, is this time travel?</h2>
        Deceptively, the implementation is simple.
        <pre class="code-block">
        use std::task::{Poll, Context};
        use std::pin::Pin;
        use std::future::Future;

        impl<T> Future for SomeCoolThing<T> {
            type Output = T; 

            fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<T> {
                let mut state = Poll::Pending;


                // Some stuff to make it "work".
                // Maybe change the state to ready?
                // Maybe save the waker for later?
                // Haha!
                state
            }        
        }</pre>

        If you noticed, you can see why Rust futures need some executor, they're completely inert.
        Even async blocks partially "generated" by the compiler, are inert as they're just an opaque type, or in Rust terms
        <pre class="code-block">
            fn some_cool_function() -> impl Future&ltOutput = ()&gt // unit type used as example</pre>
        <h3>So, how does one run a Future?</h3>
        The key is <code>.await</code> and <code>poll()</code>
        <br><br>
        <code>.await</code> just blocks the current thread until the future returns <code>Poll::Ready</code> (and a value inside).
        Itself <code>.await</code> is implemented using the earlier mentioned function.
        <br>
        
        <h2>Dance, dance, the Carmagnole! (let's make a <b>very</b> simple Future!)</h2>
        Let's make a struct for our dance: <code>Dance</code><br>
        <pre class="code-block">
        struct Dance {
            iterations: u8,
        }</pre><br>
        Let's consider that here a "ready" state would be 2 iterations of the dance. Once our dance ends, the Waker will be notified.<br>
        <pre class="code-block">
        impl Future for Dance {
            type Output = (); // Here we have nothing to return.
            // We will explain the lovely Pin later.
            // While here it's longer, using Self::Output is nicer for refactoring.
            fn poll(mut self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll&ltSelf::Output&gt {
                self.iterations += 1;


                let state = if self.iterations == 2 {
                    Poll::Ready(())
                } else {
                    cx.waker().wake_by_ref(); // Wake up !
                    Poll::Pending
                };

                state
            }
        }</pre><br>
        Running this pretty primitively using just the poll function.
        <pre class="code-block">
        fn main() {
            let mut a = Dance { iterations: 0 };
            
            let mut context = Context::from_waker(Waker::noop()); // here our waker has to do nothing

            let mut state = Pin::new(&mut a).poll(&mut context);
            dbg!(&state);

            state = Pin::new(&mut a).poll(&mut context);
            dbg!(&state);
        }</pre><br>

        Which yields us an wonderful result.
        <pre class="code-block">
        [src/main.rs:31:5] &state = Pending // first run
        [src/main.rs:33:5] &state = Ready( // second run
            (),
        )</pre><br>
        This is a <b>very</b> primitive and inefficient way to do it (disregards the entire idea of async) but it shows the basic functioning.
